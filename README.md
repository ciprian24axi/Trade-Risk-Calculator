# Trade-Risk-Calculator
A simple GUI calculator designed to help the traders outhere to easily calculate the exit moment from a open position depending on the risk taken for the trade

The most important part of the capital management when you trade forex is to know how much you may gain for a certain risk taken.

I had found very often that it takes me quiet a lot of time to open a calculator on my desktop and manualy calculate the reward for risk the taken every single time I find a potential trade and that's why I decided to code this simple GUI app.

How it works... obviously, first you have to find a moment in market when you want to get in.

1. Insert the price value at that moment
2. Depending on the chart and on how much money you want to risk set the stop loss price value 
3. Chose a risk level from 1-5 (you can change the range in the code, however 1-5 should be ok)
4. Press Calculate and see the price where you will have to place the profit stop on that transaction

The advantage over the manual calculation is that you can easily adjust the values

Simple

The risk calculator principle is very simple:

-Risk level 1 = for 100$ risk you have 100$ potential gain
-Risk level 2 = for 100$ risk you have 200$ potential gain
-Risk level 3 = for 100$ risk you have 300$ potential gain
-Risk level 4 = for 100$ risk you have 400$ potential gain
-Risk level 5 = for 100$ risk you have 500$ potential gain

Everyone is free to improve it (especialy on the graphic side) or to add more functionalities.

Thank you!!!
